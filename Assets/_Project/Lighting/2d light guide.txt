IMPORTANT: I have already set up the lighting, so all you need to do is add light objects to the scene.
To add light objects: Create -> Lights -> 2D -> Choose a type (description of types below)

IMPORTANT 2: When creating a new scene, do STEP 6, then add a GLOBAL LIGHT to see everything again like normal.
When ready to light, turn off global light (if you made and have the default one on) and add 2D light (see types of light section)

********

1. Add Universal RP from asset manager
2. Create -> Rendering -> Universal RP -> Pipeline Asset
3. Project Settings -> Graphics -> Set Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings to above
4. Create -> Rendering -> Universal RP -> 2D Renderer
5. Pipeline Asset -> General -> Renderer List -> Set default to 2D renderer
6. Edit -> Renderer Pipeline -> Universal RP -> 2D Renderer -> Upgrade Scene to 2D Renderer

---- NOW EVERYTHING SHOULD BE BLACK/UNLIT AND HAVE SPRITE-LIT-DEFAULT MATERIAL ----

7. Create Lights -> 2D -> Choose a type (list of types below)
8. Configure 2D light to target all layers appropriately
9. Configure 2D light to have settings you want (color, intensity, etc.)

---- LIST OF 2D LIGHT TYPES ----

Create -> Lights -> 2D -> Point Light (shines light in area)
*Modify inner/outer angle of point light to make spotlight

Create -> Lights -> 2D -> Global Light (shines light on everything)

Create -> Lights -> 2D -> Sprite Lightn (makes a sprite a light source sort of, hard to explain)

Create -> Lights -> 2D -> Freeform Light (make a light with a custom shape)

Create -> Lights -> 2D -> Parametric Light (make light shape with X amount of corners)

---- OTHER GOOD INFO ----

To toggle normal maps:
1. Go to the Sprite -> Sprite Editor -> Secondary Textures -> Plus Sign -> Add "_NormalMap" for name -> Set Normal Map texture
2. Make sure Normal Map texture is set to Normal Map type
3. Click lights (best to exclude global light) -> Check use normal map

Shadows (though a bit strange imo)
1. Go to gameobject -> add "Shadow Caster 2D (Experimental)" script
2. Go to light -> play with shadow intensity setting
