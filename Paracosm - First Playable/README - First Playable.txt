Known major bugs:

The player can climb walls by jumping into a wall then falling off them and jumping again while midair.
The player can uncrouch while under a low ceiling and be "shot" through some colliders.


Big questions:
Does the gameplay feel fun? Is it the right balance of story and puzzle solving?
Is the story interesting enough to keep the player interested/captivated?
How was the sound? Should there be more, less, or different sounds? Was it too loud/too quiet?
Are there any places where it was not clear what to do?
Are the puzzle mechanics too difficult? Too easy? Just right? Or a mix of the previous?

Are there any bugs you encountered during the playtest?
Are there any suggestions you have for improving the game?
